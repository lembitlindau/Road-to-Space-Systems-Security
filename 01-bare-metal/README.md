# Bare Metal Projects

Projects focused on direct hardware control without an operating system.

## Topics to Cover

- GPIO control (input/output, pull-up/down)
- Interrupts and ISR handling
- Timers and PWM
- I2C, SPI, UART communication
- ADC and sensor reading
- Assembly language basics
- Direct register manipulation

## Future Projects

- GPIO and LED control
- Button interrupt handling
- PWM motor control
- I2C sensor communication
- Real-time clock (RTC)
- Low-power modes

*Projects will be added here as I progress through bare metal development.*
