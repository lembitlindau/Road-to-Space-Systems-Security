# Road to Space Systems Security

![Road to Space Systems Security](images/road-to-space-stack.png)

This image illustrates the learning path and hierarchy of topics to study:
- Bare Metal (C / Assembly): direct hardware control, GPIO/IC/SPI, interrupts and registers — e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico, STM.
- RTOS (FreeRTOS / Zephyr): multiple threads/tasks, precise timing, scheduling and real-time concepts.
- Embedded Linux (Buildroot / Yocto): filesystems, kernels, services, networking (TCP/IP, SSH, TLS, CAN), kernel builds and drivers.
- Space Systems & Cybersecurity: RTEMS / VxWorks / QNX on satellites, Yocto/Linux for ground segments and payload operations, CCSDS/SpaceWire and security measures (Secure Boot, AppArmor, cryptography).
